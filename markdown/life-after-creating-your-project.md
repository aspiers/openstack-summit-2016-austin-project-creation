TODO: ideas for a good image? from status.openstack.org?

Note:
-   ensure it stays healthy and visible
-   this will breed confidence in your project
-   always look for opportunities to improve it

# Reactive support

Note:
- providing decent reactive support can mean the difference between
  life and death of the project


<!-- .slide: data-state="normal" id="bugs" -->
# Bug / issue tracking

image of bugs

Note:
- triage quickly
- ensure it's always clear what state each issue is in
    - if noone's working on it, that's OK as long as it's clear


<!-- .slide: data-state="normal" id="ML-support" -->
# Mailing list support

- TODO: insert image here
- usually reuse `openstack-dev@openstack.org`

Note:
- as with bugs, make sure mails don't get ignored


<!-- .slide: data-state="normal" id="IRC-channel" -->
# `#openstack-foo`

- TODO: insert image here
- TODO: show example of setup?

Note:
- important to set up project channel on FreeNode if there is
  no existing channel suitable for reuse
- register with `chanserv` and set a helpful topic

- idle on channel, make sure questions are going answered

# IRC bot

TODO: insert bot image here

Note:
- One way to avoid embarrassment of total silence is to install a
  bot - may seem like cheating, but actually delivers value!

# Proactive support

Note:
- reactive support is a good start, but for a project to really
  flourish, it needs a more proactive approach


<!-- .slide: data-state="normal" id="IRC-meetings" -->
## `#openstack-meeting`

- TODO: insert snippet of start of IRC meeting here

Note:
- links to wiki and eavesdrop
- meetings must be scheduled in one of the existing meeting channels
  in order to minimise clashes with other meetings

- TODO: insert meeting image

Note:
- personal relationships matter!

## Proactive communication

* Releases
* Blogging

Note:
- The Cross-project Working Group is available to help with
  topics which span multiple projects.

# Mentoring and guiding new contributors

TODO: insert mentoring image here

Note:
- Mentoring is perhaps the hardest thing to find time for,
  but one of the most rewarding and productive.
- Pair programming can be very effective.
- More likely to result in participation "stickiness"


<!-- .slide: data-state="normal" id="training" -->
# Training, screencasts etc.

TODO: insert training image here

Note:
- Ultimately your project is for the end users!
  So help them understand and benefit from your project.
