## <p class="bg-light-neutral">Why are we here?</p>

*   <p class="bg-tint-neutral">Created new projects under OpenStack</p>
*   <p class="bg-tint-neutral">We think it's a great idea!</p>
*   <p class="bg-tint-neutral">We want to motivate you to do the same</p>
*   <p class="bg-tint-neutral">Point out the unique aspects of our projects</p>

Note:
    - Yada yada yada ... the community welcomes every project which helps OpenStack.
    - Which is in line with the OpenStack Mission.
    - Which solves a problem.
    - Tools, libraries and more ... things which are not under spolight play an important role but unrealized by others.
