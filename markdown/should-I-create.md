## Why shouldn't I create an OpenStack project?

* Self-promotion
* Promotion of your employer
* Unnecessary duplication of effort
* Not yet experienced in upstream development
* Not prepared to take on the maintenance responsibilities!

Note:

- Competition is still OK (e.g. puppet / chef / ansible / salt)
- You're unlikely to manage an OpenStack project well
  if you've never been involved with an existing OpenStack
  project.  So spend at least a few days first making some
  upstream contributions.

## Why should I create an OpenStack project?

* Grow the OpenStack mission
* Grow my project / team
    *   Community support
    *   Discoverability: upstream visibility, awareness and contributions
* Personal growth
    *   Improving interpersonal / collaborative skills
    *   Improving technical skills
    *   Increasing public profile
    *   Good long term career aspects
        *   Change of role/jobs does not directly control this.
    *   Fun! Hacking! Collaborating! ...
