## Why shouldn't I create an OpenStack project?

<br><br>

* Re-inventing the wheel.
* Self-promotion.
* No prior experience in upstream development.
* Promotion of your employer.

Note:

- Competition is still OK (e.g. puppet / chef / ansible / salt)
-  Spend at least a few days first making some
  upstream contributions.
- Not prepared to take on the maintenance responsibilities!
- **Joke**: Ok, the talk is over, conclusion: Dont create OpenStack project.
