## RPM Packaging

*   Idea started at Vancouver Summit (May 2015)
*   Discussion about scope and team creation took considerable time
*   Governance/TC approval for Big Tent (July 2015)

*   Kickoff directly from a green field with core from Mirantis, SUSE and Red Hat


<!-- .slide: data-state="normal" id="rpm-packaging-why" -->
## Benefits of Big Tent

*   Defined an "upstream" point of contact for other OpenStack teams
*   Enable cross-project dependencies
*   "Upstream" visibility and collaboration instead of downstream efforts

## RPM Packaging: Lessons Learned

*   Starting a new effort can be overwhelming
    *   Don't decide everything at the beginning
    *   Focus on getting started and iterate quickly
*   Open Design principles gives you guidance and structure
    *   It's a feature, not an obstacle
*   Being a new project, lazy consensus approach wasn't established
*   Foster code-driven technical discussion

Note:
Many differences in downstream packaging was overwhelming to resolve
and discussions dragged a long with no actions being implemented. Situation
improved after we started to tackle each problem at a time
