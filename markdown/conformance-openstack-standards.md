## Open Source

We do not produce “open core” software.

We are committed to creating truly open source software that is usable and scalable. Truly open source software is not feature or performance limited and is not crippled. There will be no “Enterprise Edition”.

We use the Apache License, 2.0.

OSI approved
GPLv3 compatible
DFSG compatible

## Open Design

We are committed to an open design process. Every six months the development community holds a design summit to gather requirements and write specifications for the upcoming release. The design summits, which are open to the public, include users, developers, and upstream projects. We gather requirements and produce an approved roadmap used to guide development for the next six months.

The community controls the design process. You can help make this software meet your needs.


<!-- .slide: data-state="normal" id="conformance-open-development" -->
## Open Development

We maintain a publicly available source code repository through the entire development process. We do public code reviews. We have public roadmaps. This makes participation simpler, allows users to follow the development process and participate in QA at an early stage.


<!-- .slide: data-state="normal" id="conformance-open-community" -->
## Open Community

One of our core goals is to maintain a healthy, vibrant developer and user community. Most decisions are made using a lazy consensus model. All processes are documented, open and transparent.

The technical governance of the project is a community meritocracy with contributors electing technical leads and members of the Technical Committee.

All project meetings are held in public IRC channels and recorded. Additional technical communication is through public mailing lists and is archived.

# Dependencies and Optional Modules

When utilizing third party modules or libraries which are not Apache 2.0 licensed, contributors need to understand how the interaction between the modules will work and the compatibility of the licenses involved. If there are doubts or concerns, it is recommended to raise the issue in the Technical Committee Meeting to discuss with the Technical Committee how to proceed. In general, err on the side of caution here.

# Life after creating your project

 *    Choice of programming language
 *    Choice of libraries/frameworks used (quote training-labs here)
 *    How this impacts whether a project will be approved (TC)
